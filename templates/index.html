                <p>
                    I am a Systems Engineering student in Colombia, with a strong passion for software development and a clear goal to apply my skills, 
                    grow professionally, and contribute to innovative IT projects.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    I have experience developing dynamic web applications using Python and the Flask framework, 
                    building and consuming RESTful APIs, optimizing database queries, and applying object-oriented programming principles. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    I've also participated in research projects related to systems engineering, turning theory into practical solutions.
                    I am fluent in English and Spanish, highly adaptable, and committed to professional growth through teamwork, respect, and continuous learning.
