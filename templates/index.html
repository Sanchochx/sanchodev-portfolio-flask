                <p>
                    I am a Systems Engineering student in Colombia, with a strong passion for software development and a clear goal to apply my skills, 
                    grow professionally, and contribute to innovative IT projects.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    I have experience developing dynamic web applications using Python and the Flask framework, 
                    building and consuming RESTful APIs, optimizing database queries, and applying object-oriented programming principles. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    I've also participated in research projects related to systems engineering, turning theory into practical solutions.
                    I am fluent in English and Spanish, highly adaptable, and committed to professional growth through teamwork, respect, and continuous learning.

                <p>
                    I've been fascinated by computers and software since I was a kid—there was something 
                    magical about how they worked. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    As I grew up, that fascination turned into a clear goal: 
                    I wanted to create things that matter.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Programming became my tool of choice because it 
                    lets me build solutions from scratch (with just my fingers and a keyboard!) and help 
                    people solve real problems. Whether it's a simple website or a complex application, 
                    knowing that my code can make someone's life easier is what keeps me motivated and 
                    constantly learning.

        <h1 class="about-title fade-element">MY JOURNEY AND MISSION</h1>
        <p class="welcome-description fade-element">
            My mission is to evolve from a Junior Developer into a Senior Software Engineer and 
            eventually a Tech Lead, building expertise that makes a real difference. I'm committed 
            to creating solutions that positively impact millions of people while developing the 
            technical and leadership skills needed to build something of my own. In the long term, 
            I envision establishing a solid career that opens doors to founding my own company, 
            where I can combine innovation with social impact. I'm particularly passionate about 
            mastering AI-driven software development, as I believe artificial intelligence will be 
            the cornerstone of solving tomorrow's biggest challenges. Every project I work on is a 
            step toward that vision—learning, growing, and preparing to make a meaningful 
            contribution to the tech industry and society.
