        <div class="about-text-centered fade-element">
            <p>
            I am an IT Engineering student with a strong passion for software development and a clear goal: to apply my skills, grow professionally, and contribute to innovative IT projects.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
            My technical expertise includes frontend development with Angular, React, TypeScript, and responsive design using Angular Material, combined with backend development using Node.js and Express. I work with both relational and non-relational databases, implement RESTful APIs, and apply object-oriented programming principles to create robust, maintainable code.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
            I'm also proficient in Python and Flask, which I leverage for personal projects and AI-driven applications. I'm actively exploring agentic AI development, using AI agents as productivity multipliers in my development workflow while maintaining architectural decision-making and code quality oversight.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
            I've participated in systems engineering research projects, transforming theoretical concepts into practical, working solutions.
            Fluent in English and Spanish, I'm highly adaptable and committed to professional growth through teamwork, continuous learning, and delivering quality software.

                <p>
                    I've been fascinated by computers and software since I was a kid—there was something
                    magical about how they worked.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    As I grew up, that fascination turned into a clear goal:
                    I wanted to create things that matter.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Programming became my tool of choice because it
                    lets me build solutions from scratch (with just my fingers and a keyboard!) and help
                    people solve real problems. Whether it's a simple website or a complex application,
                    knowing that my code can make someone's life easier is what keeps me motivated and
                    constantly learning.

        <h1 class="about-title fade-element">MY JOURNEY AND MISSION</h1>
        <p class="welcome-description fade-element">
            My mission is to evolve from a Junior Developer into a Senior Software Engineer and
            eventually a Tech Lead, building expertise that makes a real difference. I'm committed
            to creating solutions that positively impact millions of people while developing the
            technical and leadership skills needed to build something of my own. In the long term,
            I envision establishing a solid career that opens doors to founding my own company,
            where I can combine innovation with social impact. I'm particularly passionate about
            mastering AI-driven software development, as I believe artificial intelligence will be
            the cornerstone of solving tomorrow's biggest challenges. Every project I work on is a
            step toward that vision—learning, growing, and preparing to make a meaningful
            contribution to the tech industry and society.
